# MERN Whiteboard

MERN Whiteboard is a collaborative drawing application built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides users with a platform to draw and collaborate in real-time, akin to a shared whiteboard. Utilizing the power of Socket.IO for seamless communication, users can draw simultaneously, seeing each other's changes in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can draw on the whiteboard simultaneously, with changes reflected instantly for all participants.
- **Interactive Drawing Tools**: A variety of drawing tools such as pens, brushes, colors, and erasers are available to facilitate creativity and expression.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access and contribute to the whiteboard.
- **Persistence**: Drawings are saved to a MongoDB database, allowing users to revisit and continue their work at any time.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices of all sizes, enabling users to draw on the go.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing drawings and user information.
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for enabling real-time collaboration.
- **Styling**: CSS and possibly additional styling frameworks for a visually appealing experience.
